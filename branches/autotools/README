Installing netmeterd
====================
To install netmeterd, simply type:
  $ make install

as root. This will copy netmeterd to /usr/sbin
and create the default log directory. If you
don't like the default locations, you may change
them using LOGDIR and INSDIR environment variables.

Running netmeterd
===============
Run netmeterd -h (assuming it's in your PATH), and it
will show you its usage.

need to write your own.
