 *  Three hours after the last entry, I have coded the signal handlers and
  the sanity checks and fixed the Makefile. The code of netmeterd is ready,
  but I have to write a  python script (I'm too lazy to do it in C/C++) to 
  generate some stats from log files (nobody likes reading ugly logs).
  As soon as I finish that script and the man page, netmeterd 0.1
  will be released, possible before 21 as I previously announced.
  Ah!, I forgot to mention ifdata was dropped some days ago xDD.

 *  Iface and counter class are ready (at least for the upcoming 0.1 release)
  netmeterd.cc is almost ready, we only need to write signal handlers
  and the main loop.
  *Bad news, Ayoze is out of home this weekend and I have and exam
  on Wednesday 19, so don't expect 0.1 till 21 at least.
