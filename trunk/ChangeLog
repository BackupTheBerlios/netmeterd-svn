  Three hours after the last entry, I have coded the signal handlers and
  the sanity checks and fixed the Makefile. The code of netmeterd is ready,
  but I have to write a  python script (I'm too lazy to do it in C/C++) to 
  generate some stats from log files (nobody likes reading ugly logs).
  As soon as I finish that script and the man page, netmeterd 0.1
  will be released, possible before 21 as I previously announced.
  Ah!, I forgot to mention ifdata was dropped some days ago xDD.

  Iface and counter class are ready (at least for the upcoming 0.1 release)
  netmeterd.cc is almost ready, we only need to write signal handlers
  and the main loop.
  Bad news, Ayoze is out of home this weekend and I have and exam
  on Wednesday 19, so don't expect 0.1 till 21 at least.
